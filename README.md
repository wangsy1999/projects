This is a repo to store some of the projects I finished. For your reference only. Please know that plagiarize is a violation of almost **ANY** University's policy. Especially, for NYU Tandon students, please do not copy. Your professors, Prof. Selesnick, Prof. Campisi, Prof. Pei Liu, and Prof. Christakos have my codes on brightspace or gradescope and might still remember my projects. Those projects include a Embedded System project, a RISC-V project, a Machine Learning project, a video-based instrument which is interesting, and a store management system create by java. 



I got 100/100 in all these projects and A grade in these courses. So, if you have any questions related to them, feel free to email me at wangsy1999@outlook.com
